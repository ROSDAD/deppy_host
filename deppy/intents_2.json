      "how is your life going overall ? since you hear voices since you were young i wonder whether you mean the thoughts each of us has about what to do, our opinions, including self - criticism and praise, i try to understand how severe a problem these voices are if you've managed to get to a point in life of awareness about the voices, usually when mental health people hear about voices the immediate thought is you need drugs bc you are psychotic, since this is going on for a number of years, i wonder if the problem is something different ",
      "you are right, it is not normal to hear voices that aren't your own but the fact is some people do, in my experience, medication seem to help, it is also important to understand when you hear voices the most - meaning it is important to understand what the triggers are, it is also important to understand when the voices are the least - meaning what helps you deal with the voices better, my clients have reported that their triggers are being in social gathering or around strangers or for some even the tv, trying to identify your triggers is helpful for some people, clients have also reported that listening to music, watching tv, being with friend or family helps them deal with their voices, every individual is different and you need to figure out what works for you and what triggers your voices, my suggestion is to see a therapist / health care provider and then go from there, i hope this helps ",
      "first, let me express my support and compassion for what you're going through, hearing voices can be incredibly difficult and can feel like you can't get a moment's peace, even in the privacy of your own mind, and not everyone will necessarily understand what you're dealing with, so i imagine you may also be feeling isolated or somehow different, atta girl / boy on reaching out for help ! many people find benefit to taking medications, such as risperdal, seroquel, and so on, these should be prescribed by a nurse practitioner or psychiatrist - - i do not recommend a primary care doctor venture into this area, as a general rule, discuss the options thoroughly and insist on a good rapport with your prescriber, if you decide to go this route, some people are having results with a talk - therapist to develop coping strategies, there is a new and somewhat less conventional approach to challenging voices with a professional to assist you, rather than to suppress the voices, which medication will do, there is peer - run organization and a general approach that attempts to live with voices in a different way, you can read about it in living with voices by marius romme, i have heard interviews but have not read the",

      "When it’s there, anxiety tends to direct behaviour towards the safest option. Sometimes moving cautiously is definitely the best way to go. Sometimes it’s not. Given too much say-so, anxiety can stand in the way of a lot of life.",
      "Anxiety interrupts the brain’s capacity to ignore these distractions by numbing a group of neurons in the pre-frontal cortex that are specifically involved in making choices.",
      "i hope that you will be feeling better soon",
      "Without the full capacity of the pre-frontal cortex to weigh in on decision-making, decisions are more likely to become fixed and rigid and driven by intrusive emotions that don’t deserve the influence. Mindfulness strengthens the brain’s capacity to filter out distractions to make more grounded, relevant decisions. It limits the influence of the things that don’t matter, so you can focus on the things that do.",
      "Slowing down sounds like it should be easy, but nope – life is rarely that simple. Slowing down involves a deliberate shift away from automatic thoughts and feelings and towards what is actually happening, what you are actually feeling, and what might be behind it. So much of the way we feel and our response to a situation happens automatically, but it doesn’t have to be this way. The greater awareness we have around what we are doing or feeling, the more power we have to change it.",
      "Work stress or day-to-day life stress (such as having an argument or being stuck in bad traffic) can trigger enough emotion and intrusive thoughts to influence important, unrelated decisions. Anxiety can also stem from past incidents. The emotion may have been justified then, but now it might be just getting in the way. Unwarranted anxiety can lead to overly safe decision making. By looking for where the anxiety has come from, its influence on behavior can be reduced.",
      "Don’t buy into the idea that thoughts, feelings and behaviour are a package deal. They’re not.",
      "Try challenging the presence and influence of anxiety by ‘acting as if’ there is nothing to be worried about. This might feel difficult, but the more you do it, the easier it will come. Stay with the moment. Right now, you’re okay, and you’ll keep being okay. Even if it doesn’t feel true for you, act as if it is. The point is reducing anxiety enough so that it doesn’t force itself into decisions where it isn’t needed.",
      "When there is an important decision to be made, it’s really normal to feel panicked or anxious, but you don’t have to rush your decision. Anxiety is there to protect you from danger but just because it’s raising the alarm, it doesn’t mean there is any danger about.",
      "Just because you feel a certain way or think a certain thought, doesn’t mean you have to act a certain way. This involves being more deliberate about behaviour and pushing against the automatic, habitual response. Thoughts, feelings and behaviour are interrelated. They influence each other, often without us even realising it. Change one and the other two will eventually catch up. You don’t have to believe this – just try it and watch it happen.",
      "Be mindful. Mindfulness strengthens the pre-frontal cortex, which is the part of the brain that can be sent offline by anxiety. ",

      "the short answer is : absolutely not ! the longer answer is that it might take some time to process all of the issues , and it may feel quite   muddy   in the issues for a lot longer than is tolerable ( which is why counseling may have been postponed to begin with for you , ) it's important to be realistic when entering counseling of any sort , and that the therapist be realistic with you about what you might be able to expect working with that person ( i use the words   might be able to expect   because therapy experiences can vary , ) but that not having counseling about trauma that you have experienced much earlier in your life can play a significant role in the process and how long that process could take to unpack all that may have been buried over time , it might also be helpful in counseling to work with the therapist on figuring out where to begin , but to also manage the feelings of being overwhelmed that may make it hard to continue to show up and do the work required , week in and week out , it isn't easy work trying to process past pain that you experienced , and so consistent practice of self - care , including leaning on support systems outside of therapy , is key ,",

      "absolutely not ! when we have the courage to accept the challenge to address whatever is causing us pain , the solutions often generalize to many , if not all of our symptoms , i would suggest that unresolved trauma from sexual abuse is likely a primary contributing factor , however , it is important that you first build a trusting relationship with a therapist experienced in trauma treatment as this is an area of specialty that not all therapists are skilled in treating , choosing one issue to work on , such as anxiety or depressive symptoms , and starting there will allow you the opportunity to get to know your therapist , learn coping skills for managing distressing symptoms , and establish emotional safety before jumping into trauma work ,",
